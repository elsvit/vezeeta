# web-config

Since all the projects are using webpack and create-react-app cli. This project will make sure that all of them have the same config files since we update them from while to while to improve bundle size

## Get started

```#!/bin/bash
git clone https://vezeeta-final.visualstudio.com/web-packages/_git/web-config
cd web-config
```

## Use as submodule in other projects

```#!/bin/bash
git submodule add https://vezeeta-final.visualstudio.com/web-packages/_git/web-config <directory/folder>
```
